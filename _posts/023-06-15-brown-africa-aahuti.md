**Brown Africa** by Aahuti <br>
(This poem was first published in Nepali as "Gahungoro Africa" in _Mulaykan_ magazine in 2051 B.S. and also includied as the opening section in Aahuti's 2010 A.D. book _Nepalma Varna Vyavastha ra Varga-Sangharsha_)

My red blood <br>
Holy human blood <br>
When it trickles becoming blue sweat beads <br>
You collect them forming bunds in your delicate cupped hands <br>
When I try to smell the fragrance of that labor <br>
You humiliate me and keep me away <br>
Dare to meet my gaze, priest <br>
I am an ‘untouchable’ of 20th century! <br>
A brown Africa in this round geography! <br>
I want justice <br>
I want freedom!

Your temple’s sculpture smells of my smithy, <br>
_Karahi_ on your trivet smells of my sweat <br>
Dare to meet my gaze, pious man! <br>
Either dare to smolder my existence and maintain your religion <br>
Or have courage to tear or burn the pages of scriptures that humiliate me <br>
I am a blacksmith who made the god of your temple <br>
A brown Africa in this round geography!

Sniff the clean floor of your settlement <br>
Each piece of your settlement smells of my blood <br>
Dare to meet my gaze, clean man! <br>
Either dare to fill water in my blood veins <br>
Or have courage to clean the garbage of your brain <br>
I am a _Chyame_ who collects garbage of your settlement! <br>
A brown Africa in this round geography! 

Tear the entertained glands of your mind <br>
Where is heard the melodic susurration of my music <br>
Dare to meet my gaze, a conscious man! <br>
Either dare to leash me with animals and feed me grass <br>
Or have courage to differentiate yourself from the animals <br>
I am a _Gaine_, a _Badi_ who bows _sarangi_ and plays _madal_. <br>
A brown Africa in this round geography! 

Feel my life sunken in soil <br>
Where is found a pool of my tears <br>
Dare to meet my gaze a satiated man! <br>
Either dare say that your morsel doesn’t smell of my tear <br>
Or have courage to respect my Dalit life <br>
I am a _Musahar_ ploughman who swims in soil with your oxen! <br>
A brown Africa in this round geography!

From the shoes at your feet to the cap on your head <br>
From distant horizon of your vision to your heart beats <br>
Where am I not? I am everywhere! <br>
How can you make me ‘untouchable,’ ‘touchable’ man? <br>
Either dare to stand at the witness box  of the history <br>
Or have courage to change yourself <br>
Dare to meet my gaze, priest! <br>
I am a 20th century ‘untouchable’! <br>
A brown Africa in this round geography! <br>
I want the account of my humiliated history <br>
I want freedom at any costs!
